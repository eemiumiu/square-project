Week 1

In week one I studied the basics of C language and learned how the Arduino Uno Board, the ATmega328P microcontroler4 and the multifunctional shield work.

I coded the exercises and projects while learning about the methods and functions of Arduino. How to communicate to pins. How to create your own library in C. I created the led.c library which contains methods for lighting up leds. The project for week 1 that I did was Led Library and Ledchaos, which taught me about how to light up leds by writing to pins.

Week 2

In week two I studied how to make use of buttons and interrupts, and created my own buttons.c library. I learned about serial ports and how to read input from a pin. I also learned how to use macros in my C code, how  pointers and memory addresses work in C.

The two projects I did in week 2 were Morse Trainer and Simon Says. I coded button interactions which decide the outcome of the leds lighting. As well, I coded logic into the game corresponding to each game's rules.

Week 3

In week three I studied more about memory in C through the projects and exercises, and especially memory allocation in C. I also learned to make use of the Display LED of the expansion shield, and how to make use of the potentiometer. I created my own display library which contains methods I created for displaying diffrent outputs to the Display LED.

The project I did for week 3 was Nim, where I coded things like generating a seed from the ADC, displaying diffrent values on the Display LED by using my own display.c library. I also created bit maps with hexadecimal values which can be used in methods for displaying on the display led things like numbers, letters or symbols.

Week 4

In week four I studied through the exercises and projetcts i did the functionality of timers and interrupts. I also learned how to use the buzzer and how to output diffrent frequencies to the buzzer to create sounds, and created my own buzzer.c library with methods that i used in my projects. I also studied structures and dynamic structures and how they can be used in my code.

The week 4 project, Lunar Lander, I made use of timers, typedef structures, the buzzer library, to create the game. The project solidified the knowladge I acquired so far and helped me understand C programming concepts better.

Week 5

In week 5 I chose my final C embeded project which is the Square game. In this week I created a skeleton of the game and brainstormed diffrent ideas on how to make the game.

Week 6

The Square game project advanced. I created diffrent structures in my code, I now use memory allocation and pointers in my code responsibly to make my code as memory efficient as possible. I make use of all my created libraries, timers, interrupts, the LED Display, the LED lights, the buzzer, and my game logic  abides by all the game rules.
