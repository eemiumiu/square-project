The Square Game is a project in C for Arduino Uno board. 
It utilises the PlatformIO,a CLI (or IDE extension), which is used for building the project, doing serial port monitor testing, and installing dependencies like C libraries with definitions for the microcontroller registers. 
The Arduino is equipped with a Multi-function Shield Expansion which utilises a buzzer, 4 buttons, a potentiometer, 4 LEDs and a 4 digits 7 segments LED display.

#####To play the game on the Arduino that's equiped with the Whadda WPSH209 Shield Expantion, 
#####open the project in an IDE and use either the PlatformIO CLI or Extention to download the dependencies, 
#####build the project and upload it to the Arduino.

The C program makes use of pointers, efficient memory allocation, communication with hardware components, writing directly to pins, created libraries with my own custom methods.
